# Contribution
Any contributions are very welcome! Make sure to first post an issue with the features you want to implement and try to stick to the coding style of the project. Happy coding!

# TODO
* **Character class support**: due to missing class support some calculations may be slightly off but the functionality remains intact.

# What's inside?
* **OGame client** `ogame/game/client.py`: client for scraping information from the game and controlling the account.
* **OGameAPI client** `ogame//api/client.py`: client for retrieving information from the official public API.
* **OGame engine** `ogame/game/engine.py` game engine used for calculations e.g. distance between two coordinate systems.
* **OGame bot** `bot/bot.py` implementation of Cruiser's logic, or alternatively, the brain of the operation.
